# AngshuWallet Smart Contract

This repository contains the source code for the AngshuWallet smart contract written in Solidity.

## Overview

AngshuWallet is a simple Ethereum smart contract that provides basic functionalities for managing a wallet. It allows the owner to deposit and withdraw tokens, check the current balance, and buy non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The contract is written in Solidity version 0.8.9.

## Features

- **DepositToken:** Allows the owner to deposit tokens into the wallet.

- **WithdrawToken:** Allows the owner to withdraw tokens from the wallet, subject to available balance. It includes a check for low balance, throwing a `LowBalance` error if the withdrawal amount exceeds the current balance.

- **getBalance:** Retrieves the current balance of the wallet.

- **getContractAddress:** Retrieves the address of the contract.

- **getContractBalance:** Retrieves the Ether balance of the contract.

- **BuyNFT:** Initiates the process of buying a non-fungible token (NFT). It internally calls the `WithdrawToken` function.
